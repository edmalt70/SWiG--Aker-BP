%> @brief reliable acoustic path channel model
%> details - assumes that communications are in the so-called RAP-bowl, in
%which a shallow node communicates with a deeper node. In general, the
%lateral displacement between the two nodes will be < 6 times the depth
%difference between them. This is also not a terrible model for
%deep-to-deep communications less than 10-15 km distant
%no handling of top reflection or bottom bounce
%no modeling of refractive recurve

        %some rate unrelated to information-theoretic bit error rates -
        %most likely related to rapidly time-varying surface reflections
        %this variable will cause a random dropout to occur at a particular
